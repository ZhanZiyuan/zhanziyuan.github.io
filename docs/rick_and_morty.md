## [Season 1 Episode 2 Lawnmower Dog](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3333824/)

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Lawnmower_Dog/Transcript)

**Jerry**: Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick.
You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing
you could whip up
that might help make this dog a little smarter,
would you?

**Rick**: I thought the whole point of having a dog
was to feel superior, Jerry.
If I were you,
I wouldn't pull that thread.
Come on, Morty.

**杰瑞**：等下，瑞克。
你不会碰巧有什么能让这狗更聪明的科学发明吧？

**瑞克**：养狗的自的不就是为了有优越感吗，杰瑞。
我要是你，就不会想做这事。
走，莫蒂。

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Close_Rick-Counters_of_the_Rick_Kind/Transcript)

**Rick (C-137)**: I’m the Rick!
And so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance.
You wanted to be safe from the government so you became a stupid government.
That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.

### [简体中文](https://bangumi.tv/ep/359060)

**瑞克**：我只是Rick！在组成这个愚蠢的联盟以前，你们也是。
你们想免受政府的迫害，于是你们自己变成了愚蠢的政府。
所以我比这里的每一个Rick都更像真正的Rick。

## [Season 2 Episode 10 The Wedding Squanchers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4832278/)

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wedding_Squanchers/Transcript)

**Rick**: Hi everybody I’m Rick.
You know when I first met Bird Person he was…
listen I’m not the nicest guy in the universe because I’m the smartest,
and being nice is something stupid people do to hedge their bets.
Now I haven’t been exactly subtle about how little I trust marriage,
I couldn’t make it work
and I could turn a black hole into a sun
so at a certain point you got to ask yourself what are the odds this is legit?
Not just some big lie we’re telling ourselves because we’re afraid to die alone?
Because, you know, that’s exactly how we all die, alone.
But, but here’s the thing Bird Person is my best friend
and if he loves Tammy well then I love Tammy too.
To friendship,
to love and to my greatest adventure yet;
opening myself up to others.

## [Season 3 Episode 3 Pickle Rick](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5218268/)

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Pickle_Rick/Transcript)

**Dr. Wong**: Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?

**Pickle Rick**: So I wouldn't have to come here.

**Dr. Wong**: Why didn't you want to come here?

**Pickle Rick**: Because I don't respect therapy,
because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform,
create, and destroy for a living,
and when I don't like something about the world,
I change it.
And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall
to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean
which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.
I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking,
which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat,
but not something I want for myself.
I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle.
When I feel like it. So...you asked.

**Dr. Wong**: Rick,
the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence
and the sickness destroying your family
is that everyone in your family, you included,
use intelligence to justify sickness.
You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind
as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse.
And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept
for you is that it's your mind within your control.
You chose to come here, you chose to talk
-to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.
You are the master of your universe,
and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces.
Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.
I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy,
the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass.
Because the thing about repairing,
maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure.
There's no way to do it so wrong you might die.
It's just work. And the bottom line is,
some people are okay going to work,
and some people well, some people would rather die.
Each of us gets to choose.

### [简体中文](https://bangumi.tv/ep/718062)

**王医生**：瑞克，
你那毋庸置疑的智慧和摧毁你家庭的疾病之间唯一的联系，
就在于你家人，包括你自己，都用智慧来为疾病辩护。
你似乎时而将自己的思想视为势不可挡的力量，
时而又将其视为无法逃脱的诅咒，
我认为这是因为对你来说，
唯一真正难以理解的概念就是它是你的思想，在你的掌控之中。
你选择来到这里，你选择与我交谈，贬低我的职业，
就像你选择成为一块腌黄瓜一样。
你是你宇宙的主宰，却浑身沾满老鼠血和粪便，
你那庞大的头脑简直就是在你自己的手中枯萎。
我毫不怀疑，你会对治疗感到无比无聊，
就像我刷牙擦屁股时感到无聊一样，
因为修理、维护和清洁的意义在于：它不是冒险。
这些事做错了你也不会死。
这只是工作而已，
归根结底，有些人愿意工作，而有些人，嗯，有些人宁愿去死。
我们每个人都要选择。

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Seat/Transcript)

**Hologram of Rick**: There he is. There's our guy.
Congrats, Tony.
Have fun with your stupid toilet
that you get to use all by yourself now.
Enjoy using it all by yourself while you sit there
and think about how nobody wants to be around you
and how you ruined it for yourself
because you're a huge piece of shit
Look at you sitting there,
King Shit on his throne of loneliness.
Enjoy this toilet with a thousand of me
screaming every time you take a shit
All hail his majesty,
the sa-a-ddest piece of garbage in the entire cosmos.
Long live the big, bad, doo-doo daddy.
May his reign last 1,000 years.

## [Season 4 Episode 6 Never Ricking Morty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10655686/)

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Never_Ricking_Morty/Transcript)

**Morty**: So what do you think?

**Rick**: Wow. Where did you get this thing?

**Morty**: The citadel of Ricks gift shop.
Do you really like it?
I didn't think you'd even care.

**Rick**: What? Morty.
No. I love it. You did the most important thing.
You... you bought something.

**Morty**: What?

**Rick**: You bought something.
With money. God. I love money so much, Morty.

**Morty**: Are you being sarcastic?

**Rick**: Merchandise, Morty.
Your only purpose in life is to buy and consume merchandise.
And you did it. You went into a store...
an actual honest to God store...
And you bought something.
You didn't ask questions or raise ethical complaints.
You... you just looked straight into the bleeding jaws of capitalism
and said "yes, daddy, please." And I'm...
I'm so proud of you.
I only wish you could've bought more.
I... I love buying things so much, Morty.

**Morty**: Rick, are... are you... Do you need to go to the hospital?

**Rick**: I love you, Morty. Give grandpa a kiss.
Give... give... gimme... Give grandpa a kiss.
Lips if you want. What... whatever you're comfortable with.
Some cultures do that.

**Rick**: That was sweet.
Thank you. I... I love you.
You're my little buddy.

……

**Rick**: Hey, what the fuck, Morty?
The train you got me just completely derailed itself.
There's blood all over the windows on it.

**Morty**: Oh, man, I'm sorry, Rick.
I guess I'll return it.

**Rick**: Return... Are you insane?
Did you hear nothing I said? Buy another one, Morty.
Consume, Morty.
Nobody's out there shopping with this fucking virus.
Where's your fucking wallet?!

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/The_Vat_of_Acid_Episode/Transcript)

**Morty**:
Y'know, it was fun, Rick. Real fun.
Y'know I-I-I definitely sowed those oats.
But I think you invented
a little lesson for me along the way.
Living without consequences is great,
but then I started wondering...
what am I living for?
What am I building?
If I'm always looking back, I'm never looking ahead.
And then it hit me.
We are who we are because of consequences.
You can't live without consequences, y'know?
You feel me?

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/That%27s_Amorte/Transcript)

**Morty**: You did it, didn’t you.
You couldn’t change everyone’s taste, but you could make it…
distasteful. It wasn’t the death, was it?

**Rick**: It was the complexity of life.

**Morty**: God, what was the point?

**Rick**: If you’re asking whether this was a story about right and wrong,
the answer is, I don’t care.

**Morty**: So what do we do?

**Rick**: Cells consume, Morty.
Life itself is wrong, and that means death is right.
But you can’t side with that.
So you live, even when it means eating.
And Fred here really did it well.

## [Season 7 Episode 10 Fear No Mort](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29371876/)

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Fear_No_Mort/Transcript)

**Morty**: So, what are you? Like, the Hole?
The Hole's promoter? The Hole's intern?

**Fear Hole salesman**: Is there a hole here?

**Morty**: Right. I'm supposed to go in there and be shocked
that there's no hole, or that there is a hole.
What difference would it make?

**Fear Hole salesman**: Hmm. You are hard to scare.

**Morty**: And Rick isn't, right?
The Hole's gonna, like, suck on him forever
because his big secret is that he's got the most fear?

**Fear Hole salesman**: Well,
we can certainly say you're not afraid to be reductive.
I doubt your grandpa has more fear
than the average asshole in a Denny's.

**Fear Hole salesman**: If anything,
he seems pretty brave.
He's certainly not afraid to die.
Maybe that makes his fear extra-delicious.

**Morty**: So, what, he's scared of love?

**Fear Hole salesman**: Everyone's scared of love,
dipshit.
You learn that in your 20s.
It takes a very rare, very powerful being
to be terrified of happiness.

**Morty**: Dumb.

**Fear Hole salesman**: You're dumb.
That's why you're not scared to be happy.
The smarter you are, the more you know.
Happiness is a trap. It can't last forever.
Let's say you meet the love of your life.
Well, it's still gonna end.
It's inevitable, whether by the slow pull of a disease,
or the shock of loose footing on a hiking trail.
Whether it be the corrosion of two personalities
that reshape each other until they're incompatible,
or maybe the old stranger in a bar
who says the things that need to be said,
to that person, that night.
The point is, happiness always ends.
Best-case scenario. Think about this.
Best case is that you die at the same time.
Yikes.

**Morty**: Can't the Hole just let me go, then?
Sounds like I don't matter.

**Fear Hole salesman**: You don't.
But if you go, you'll take him away.
Don't worry. Rick will die before accepting happiness.
After that, we'll chase you with some clowns
or some dumb shit like that.
But Grandpa...
Yummy, yummy. Grandpa's gonna die.
Just like Diane.

……

**Rick**: $8 for a side of bacon?

**Morty**: Are you fucking kidding me?

**Rick**: It's a symptom of a larger concern, Morty.
If capitalism collapses...

**Morty**: Are we done here?

**Rick**: I don't know.
Aren't you a little afraid at this point
of the Hole itself?

**Morty**: What?

**Rick**: I swear to God, if we're still climbing out
of this fucking hole two seasons from now...

**Morty**: Maybe that was it.

**Rick**: What?

**Morty**: Maybe we needed to let go of our fear of uncertainty.
You know?

**Rick**: Right.
I... I'd say we're pretty native to that at this point.
Okay. Thank you, Hole.

**Morty**: Thank you, Hole.
We... We no longer need to know if we're in you.
So, bye.

**Rick**: Are you afraid we're still in it?

**Morty**: I mean, I hope we're not,
but if we are...

**Rick**: We'll find out eventually.

**Morty**: Which no longer scares me.

**Rick**: Same. Okay. I'm gonna go get drunk.

I... I know what I'm afraid of.
I'm afraid you'd never say that in real life.
I'm afraid that if I jumped into a hole,
you wouldn't even bother jumping in after me.
You'd just stand there and watch.
This entire thing has been about me.
You're not even in the Hole, are you?

**Hole Rick**: Thank you for visiting the Fear Hole, Morty.
Your fear of relying on Rick has been delicious.

**Morty**: Dear God!

**Rick**: Morty, how was it?
Was it spiders?

**Morty**: Oh. Oh, jeez. Oh, my God, no.
You... You didn't go in at all?

**Rick**: No. It's a one-person ride.
You can't face two fears at the same time.
If my fear was fire and yours was water...

**Morty**: I get it. It's fine.
It really is fine. Huh.

**Rick**: You do seem a little less burdened.

**Morty**: Rick, am I irreplaceable?

**Rick**: I mean, define irreplaceable.

**Morty**: That's good. Good.
I'm back.
