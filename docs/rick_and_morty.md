## [Season 1 Episode 2 Lawnmower Dog](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3333824/)

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Lawnmower_Dog/Transcript)

**Jerry**: Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick.
You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing
you could whip up
that might help make this dog a little smarter,
would you?

**Rick**: I thought the whole point of having a dog
was to feel superior, Jerry.
If I were you,
I wouldn't pull that thread.
Come on, Morty.

**杰瑞**：等下，瑞克。
你不会碰巧有什么能让这狗更聪明的科学发明吧？

**瑞克**：养狗的自的不就是为了有优越感吗，杰瑞。
我要是你，就不会想做这事。
走，莫蒂。

**Rick (C-137)**: I’m the Rick!
And so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance.
You wanted to be safe from the government so you became a stupid government.
That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.

## [Season 2 Episode 10 The Wedding Squanchers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4832278/)

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wedding_Squanchers/Transcript)

**Rick**: Hi everybody I’m Rick.
You know when I first met Bird Person he was…
listen I’m not the nicest guy in the universe because I’m the smartest,
and being nice is something stupid people do to hedge their bets.
Now I haven’t been exactly subtle about how little I trust marriage,
I couldn’t make it work
and I could turn a black hole into a sun
so at a certain point you got to ask yourself what are the odds this is legit?
Not just some big lie we’re telling ourselves because we’re afraid to die alone?
Because, you know, that’s exactly how we all die, alone.
But, but here’s the thing Bird Person is my best friend
and if he loves Tammy well then I love Tammy too.
To friendship,
to love and to my greatest adventure yet;
opening myself up to others.

## [Season 3 Episode 3 Pickle Rick](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5218268/)

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Pickle_Rick/Transcript)

**Dr. Wong**: Rick,
the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence
and the sickness destroying your family
is that everyone in your family,
you included,
use intelligence to justify sickness.
You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force
and as an inescapable curse,
and I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you
is that it's your mind,
within your control.
You chose to come here, you chose to talk,
to belittle my vocation,
just as you chose to become a pickle.
You are the master of your universe
and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces,
your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.
I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy,
the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass,
because the thing about repairing,
maintaining,
and cleaning is;
it's not an adventure.
There's no way to do it so wrong you might die.
It's just work, and the bottom line
is some people are okay going to work,
and some people,
well,
some people would rather die.
Each of us gets to choose.

### [简体中文](https://bangumi.tv/ep/718062)

**王医生**：瑞克，
你那毋庸置疑的智慧和摧毁你家庭的疾病之间唯一的联系，
就在于你家人，包括你自己，都用智慧来为疾病辩护。
你似乎时而将自己的思想视为势不可挡的力量，
时而又将其视为无法逃脱的诅咒，
我认为这是因为对你来说，
唯一真正难以理解的概念就是它是你的思想，在你的掌控之中。
你选择来到这里，你选择与我交谈，贬低我的职业，
就像你选择成为一块腌黄瓜一样。
你是你宇宙的主宰，却浑身沾满老鼠血和粪便，
你那庞大的头脑简直就是在你自己的手中枯萎。
我毫不怀疑，你会对治疗感到无比无聊，
就像我刷牙擦屁股时感到无聊一样，
因为修理、维护和清洁的意义在于：它不是冒险。
这些事做错了你也不会死。
这只是工作而已，
归根结底，有些人愿意工作，而有些人，嗯，有些人宁愿去死。
我们每个人都要选择。

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Seat/Transcript)

There he is. There's our guy.
Congrats, Tony.
Have fun with your stupid toilet
that you get to use all by yourself now.
Enjoy using it all by yourself while you sit there
and think about how nobody wants to be around you
and how you ruined it for yourself
because you're a huge piece of shit
Look at you sitting there,
King Shit on his throne of loneliness.
Enjoy this toilet with a thousand of me
screaming every time you take a shit
All hail his majesty,
the sa-a-ddest piece of garbage in the entire cosmos.
Long live the big, bad, doo-doo daddy.
May his reign last 1,000 years.

## [Season 4 Episode 6 Never Ricking Morty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10655686/)

Wow. Where did you get this thing?
The citadel of Ricks gift shop.
Do you really like it?
I didn't think you'd even care. What? Morty.
No. I love it. You did the most important thing.
You... you bought something. What? You bought something.
With money. God. I love money so much, Morty.
Are you being sarcastic?
Merchandise, Morty.
Your only purpose in life is to buy and consume merchandise.
And you did it. You went into a store...
an actual honest to God store...
And you bought something.
You didn't ask questions or raise ethical complaints.
You... you just looked straight into the bleeding jaws of capitalism
and said "yes, daddy, please." And I'm...
I'm so proud of you.
I only wish you could've bought more.
I... I love buying things so much, Morty.
Rick, are... are you... Do you need to go to the hospital?
I love you, Morty. Give grandpa a kiss.
Give... give... gimme... Give grandpa a kiss.
Lips if you want. What... whatever you're comfortable with.
Some cultures do that.
That was sweet. Thank you. I... I love you.
You're my little buddy.
Okay. Let's watch some interdimensional cable.
( Television clicks, static crackles ) ( Train whistle blows )
So you're saying my father And his kingdom...
Well, yes... it's based on the fusion of a sumerian God named "ya"
And a mesopotamian God named "way."
And we're in a toy train?
Yes. It's enough to really make you question All of existence, isn't it?
So what do you think you're gonna do about it?
I'm gonna do what I've always done.
I'm gonna get the fuck outta here. Father of omens!
Give me blood beyond sight! ( Crackling ) Hey, what the fuck, Morty?
The train you got me just completely derailed itself.
There's blood all over the windows on it. Oh, man, I'm sorry, Rick.
I guess I'll return it. Return... Are you insane?
Did you hear nothing I said? Buy another one, Morty.
Consume, Morty. Nobody's out there shopping with this fucking virus.
Where's your fucking wallet?!
