**Jerry**: Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick.
You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing
you could whip up
that might help make this dog a little smarter,
would you?

**Rick**: I thought the whole point of having a dog
was to feel superior, Jerry.
If I were you,
I wouldn't pull that thread.
Come on, Morty.

**杰瑞**：等下，瑞克。
你不会碰巧有什么能让这狗更聪明的科学发明吧？

**瑞克**：养狗的自的不就是为了有优越感吗，杰瑞。
我要是你，就不会想做这事。
走，莫蒂。

## [Season 3 Episode 3 Pickle Rick](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5218268/)

### [English](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Pickle_Rick/Transcript)

**Dr. Wong**: Rick,
the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence
and the sickness destroying your family
is that everyone in your family,
you included,
use intelligence to justify sickness.
You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force
and as an inescapable curse,
and I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you
is that it's your mind,
within your control.
You chose to come here, you chose to talk,
to belittle my vocation,
just as you chose to become a pickle.
You are the master of your universe
and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces,
your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.
I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy,
the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass,
because the thing about repairing,
maintaining,
and cleaning is;
it's not an adventure.
There's no way to do it so wrong you might die.
It's just work, and the bottom line
is some people are okay going to work,
and some people,
well,
some people would rather die.
Each of us gets to choose.

**王医生**：瑞克，
你那毋庸置疑的智慧和摧毁你家庭的疾病之间唯一的联系，
就在于你家人，包括你自己，都用智慧来为疾病辩护。
你似乎时而将自己的思想视为势不可挡的力量，
时而又将其视为无法逃脱的诅咒，
我认为这是因为对你来说，
唯一真正难以理解的概念就是它是你的思想，在你的掌控之中。
你选择来到这里，你选择与我交谈，贬低我的职业，
就像你选择成为一块腌黄瓜一样。
你是你宇宙的主宰，却浑身沾满老鼠血和粪便，
你那庞大的头脑简直就是在你自己的手中枯萎。
我毫不怀疑，你会对治疗感到无比无聊，
就像我刷牙擦屁股时感到无聊一样，
因为修理、维护和清洁的意义在于：它不是冒险。
这些事做错了你也不会死。
这只是工作而已，
归根结底，有些人愿意工作，而有些人，嗯，有些人宁愿去死。
我们每个人都要选择。
