# [Capitalism as Battles over Vital Forces](https://doi.org/10.25620/e240530-1)

Thank you very much.
Um, this is my first time to be ICI
and also first time in this part of Berlin.
&nbsp;
And as I told my friends here,
I feel quite intimidated when I walked around downstairs
because I never seen such high level of density of fun.
&nbsp;
You know, having bit of fun is good,
but you see all the fun come together
and people consciously create
&nbsp;
and enjoy fun, uh,
sometimes feel I probably don't belong here
and sudden what, what kind of life I'm having, but have,
&nbsp;
but concentrated and,
and intensive fun, I suppose, is
what the revolution is about.
And the students here,
and I I, if anyone listen, I must say a big thanks to them.
&nbsp;
And the students in the us, UK
and other parts of Europe, of course, other parts of world
as well, are injecting a huge,
&nbsp;
very forceful, um,
somehow elusive, uh, unpredictable,
uh, power into our political life now.
And it is always difficult to analyze a student's politics
&nbsp;
because, you know, how do we locate their class position?
I mean, these people say, oh, they are,
they are elite students anyway.
&nbsp;
You know, they all perform like Columbia University,
what kind of universities that, uh,
but at the same time, uh, they don't have a fixed, uh,
&nbsp;
socioeconomic, uh, position in the way
that they are self-conscious, uh, of, um,
so are they really, uh,
represent a concentrated form of public consciousness?
&nbsp;
Or are they really just a marginal, uh, EEC exaggerate,
representing certain exaggerated version of understanding
of society and history?
&nbsp;
So that is difficult to tell,
but I feel that that kind of power, the force
that in golf, the current political life
&nbsp;
compels us to address that question.
And of course, the historical analogy can be helpful in
this, uh, incident.
So the natural comparison is go back to the 1960s,
&nbsp;
but as a students movement now, also reminded me
of a classical question of the 20th century,
which is why revolutions led
&nbsp;
by working class ideologies led by protter theories
took place in societies, in countries
where had hardly any working class population.
&nbsp;
So of course, this is a question the Chinese intellectual
have been asking, how should I understand the socialist
revolution in China means there was hardly
&nbsp;
any industrial workers.
So this is the interesting question for me, is
that if we think like a students think of them
&nbsp;
as a population.
So think, oh, you are coming from certain class, a group
of people, so you have certain identity,
&nbsp;
you will do these certain things.
Uh, this probably,
this is probably quite impoverished understanding
of history.
And then the fact that a pro
&nbsp;
revolution could take place, uh, where there was no,
or hardly any pro population really also
called our attention to a very important theme,
&nbsp;
which is nicely captured by today, by, by the title
of your round table, labored Change.
This means change, need labor
&nbsp;
change does not take place automatically or mechanically.
So you have certain population, imagine they
as they have certain material interest pursuit,
&nbsp;
and they, they follow their interest.
And as they make change, no change take place.
Of course, it need this material basis,
&nbsp;
need this physical labor as a foundation, uh,
based on which people develop a certain consciousness.
But also you do need lots of intellectual labor,
&nbsp;
and you need lots of, of course, organizational labor.
And the reason that the prota revolution could take place
in Russia, China, and in many other third world countries,
&nbsp;
I think it's quite genuine attempt for
building socialism in, uh, I mean, yeah, like Yugoslavia,
which I think provides a very important lesson
&nbsp;
for today's world, how you can live in unity
with that transcend, uh, uh,
group identities.
And I said, so this is, this was possible
&nbsp;
because of the intellectual labor,
because it was a labor change.
It was consciously pursued change.
Um, and in a way,
&nbsp;
I was thinking on the train coming from Haah this afternoon,
probably this pro revolution in the paraphrase
in the, you know, the beginning of the 20th century
&nbsp;
is probably closer to what Marx
and especially people like, uh, Lukach
envisioned about the pro revolution,
because it was really about the working
&nbsp;
and the reworking on consciousness.
And it is really go beyond immediate
material understanding of your life.
If you look at the socialist revolution, like in China,
&nbsp;
search, the very early on the question of gender,
uh, women's liberation was
among the top in the list of agendas,
&nbsp;
probably more so than the European working class
social movement, because working class we know
for a long time in the West was quite a patriarchical,
&nbsp;
was very male dominated.
And as a reason is why issues like women,
uh, family relations
and uh, also the importance of culture,
&nbsp;
including focal culture, uh, was given
so much attention in the periphery, precisely
because in order
to pursue social transformation in the periphery, you need
&nbsp;
to consciously develop a total social view.
You have to see suppressions or oppression
or repression, not only in factory,
&nbsp;
because hardly there's any factory.
You have to see that in your family, clan, temples,
how festival was organized.
And you have to look at in the kitchen, in the bedroom, uh,
&nbsp;
in the backyard of the houses, and, and,
and then you articulate a sense of, uh,
okay, the current situation is in just unbearable,
&nbsp;
certain change have to take place.
So that kind of, the totality according to Gram, uh, uh,
according to lukash is very important, uh, uh,
&nbsp;
for Marxist understanding.
He said, okay, what's the difference between Marxism
and the bourgeois?
Uh, social sciences is not that, you know,
&nbsp;
Marx talk more about the economy and et cetera,
but it is that, is, is a notion of a totality to look at,
&nbsp;
uh, uh, to look at, uh, uh, economy as a part of total,
uh, human life.
And then of course, a notion of totality also means a
&nbsp;
ins correlation between practice and theory, right?
You use, uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah,
you use theory become part of practice.
&nbsp;
And then it is through a theoretical understanding about
what society is like.
Then you also develop your new subjectivity.
&nbsp;
So, uh, we also become a new person,
and then we will act in a new way.
And in this way we learn more.
&nbsp;
So the theory and the practice also become a unity, uh,
uh, so totality.
And then through the notion of totality.
&nbsp;
So the action go beyond the immediate calculation,
immediate pursued for immediate material interest.
So the totality here is, you can say, is a,
&nbsp;
the transcendence, but is a very grounded, experientially
grounded transcendence rather than ideational transcendence.
So this actually was, uh, uh, I mean, um, in the,
&nbsp;
the anticolonial movement, there's also, uh,
a similar situation.
If you look at the, you know, the philosophy of Gandhi
&nbsp;
and et cetera, there is also, you know, you
how have this society need total transformation.
And, but total transformation is not based
&nbsp;
narrowly defined class relation, et cetera.
But it's really related to, uh, the, the, the,
the social life is organized as a whole
&nbsp;
and how we live our life,
and how we perceive, uh, our as our lives.
So that is the, the, uh, uh, I just, I mean, then
&nbsp;
I thought the notion of life force, uh, could be useful,
uh, to help us to think through these questions,
&nbsp;
then the thinking capitalism
and the global dominance, as well as a revolution,
as a battlefield over life force.
Uh, so I think my main purpose today is just invite you
&nbsp;
to think whether or not the notion of life force
or to any has any value.
Uh, I come across this notion, life of force,
&nbsp;
Xing Li in Chinese, purely because my into cultures.
The young people in China mentioned that repeatedly,
uh, as you know, there is really a quite widespread
&nbsp;
and acute mental health crisis in China, depression,
suicide, et cetera.
And as a way young people describe their condition
&nbsp;

of being depressed, uh, is often, uh,


through the notion of life force.


They said, I feel my life force is stolen.


I feel I'm draining my life force


and I'm losing my life force.


But after something positive for them, for instance,


a good conversation


and, you know, engage in a public event,


which I also organize a bit through art and et cetera.


And then, uh, the comment is often feel, oh, you know, the,


the life force come back, feel the life force being, uh, uh,


nourished, uh, life force become augmented,


become enlarged.


The enlarged is, is often, uh, the, the, the imaginary


of enlargement of live force is often, uh, used.


So, I mean, it's very close to Spinoza, um,


uh, I a perception of, of the world.


Uh, so the world is organized around, around the life force,


and there's a dominant question for them, is that why


I'm losing my life force?


Why the all external forces take away my life force


and how I can get back my, uh, uh, life force.


Um, and this question, the reason that they, uh,


use their life for life force


to describe the living condition.


Of course, it has lot to do


with the political economy and et cetera.


Uh, people do talk about, you know, exploitation.


You can say, oh, you know, people steal your life force.


Basically, you work too hard. People exploit to you.


Or we can talk about the political repression.


You know, you don't have a freedom.


You cannot express yourself.


Of course, you feel your life force is contained,


and the young people do use language such exploitation


or repression to describe their situation.


But, uh, interestingly, when they use


categories such exploitation


or repression, very quickly, the message became quite,


uh, fatalistic or even cynical.


They say, of course, I know I'm being


exploited, and that's it.


I can't do anything about it.


Is quite melon colleague, uh, also fatalistic,


uh, or pessimistic, uh,


and description of the structural condition.


They're being exploited


and being repressed by something that completely


beyond their control.


But when they mention life force,


the meaning change is no longer to say,


or we are just being exploited.


It immediately, uh,


brings in a sense of struggle.


You know, my life force is being taken away


and I want to cultivate my own life force.


So there is a sense of struggle.


So the agency somehow emerged in this


dark situation.


Uh, also when people talk about the life of force,


also have a sense of dialectics, uh,


uh, connotation, meaning


that when you talk about exploitation


and, uh, uh, repression is mainly talking about


how external force, you know, act on them.


But when they talk about the life force, the self


become a agent, of course,


they're not celebrating kind of okay.


I mean, I mean, I'm, uh, uh, you know, the, the, uh, uh,


the power of the self or anything.


But here you can see the self try to,


to act back, try to act back.


So they say, while they recognize how, uh,


difficult the situation is,


but they feel there is a life in, in inside of the self,


and they try to regain or push back.


So I found that that, so the notion of life of force


as a kind of interface between that type


of self consciousness on one hand,


and the consciousness about the structural condition, uh,


uh, is interesting


and is interesting entry point for thinking about our life


and politics in a way that is not only to


elucidate objective condition,


but in a way in order to mobilize further certain type


of consciousness and a certain type of agency.


Um, as I mentioned, I mean, the emergence


of this consciousness definitely have to do with the fact


that disappearance of a class


as a, uh, meaningful category, uh,


for people to think of their life.


Actually, young Chinese, uh, use the word class very often,


but you can see they're using the word class as a text


to describe and to make certain statement,


we are under class.


And, uh, but, but,


but there's a adjunctive self does not come through.


Uh, this is because, uh, you know,


there's no party associated with the class.


And then there working condition, uh, is not conducive


to bring in classical class politics.


And also, uh, with the massification


of higher education across the world since the 1960s,


and in the global south since 1980s, 1990s.


And many people do not really genuinely perceive


themselves as labor.


So they were more thinking themselves as a, a talent


and, uh, and, uh, uh, just interesting individuals.


This is how they perceive themselves.


So the pain is coming from this life of force.


Question I gave you very quick, um, vette about how, uh,


uh, uh, uh, uh, many large IT


companies hire, uh, staff.


So they have the 3, 4, 5, uh, formula in hiring.


Basically, they, uh, hire three persons,


pay them four persons a salary,


and ask them to do five persons work.


So I, for a while, I was very puzzled.


I said, okay, is I just wanna save money or,


or, uh, so why don't they just, uh, you know, uh,


hire five people and pay five persons average salary,


ask them to do five persons work,


which is much more manageable


because you have all the standard, uh, template out there


to regulate such, uh, organization.


And when I mentioned that,


and the young people say, of course not.


If they hire five, pay, five person salary, ask us


to do five personal work, then


we are just workers.


The whole point is that they don't hire us as workers,


as labor, as wage labor.


They hire us as a talent, as someone


will always do extraordinary


above average work, and always outperform the average, and


therefore, who are also always a demand, uh,


above average, uh, rewards and the salary.


So this is the how, how, I mean,


you can say this is a, you know, a new form


of labor exploitation,


but here, what what make it works is not just, you know,


you, you, you standardize the, the work method,


or you organize this assembly line


and to, to monitor the no, it is really


to ens instill this sense of, I, I'm, I'm, I'm,


I'm extraordinary, uh, very creative, uh,


individual full potentials.


But of course, this is a familiar stories.


There's 3, 4, 5,


but this put in the 3, 4, 5 formula is,


I haven't seen somewhere else.


But I mean, the logic is not difficult to understand.


But my key point is that in this condition,


what is the, the response of young people,


of these actually workers back?


Because here the labor consciousness probably is not


applicable, but actually you should listen to them.


They say, okay, I will receive four person's salary.


But the work, uh, uh, the workload is actually for 5%,


only three of the share that that kind of pressure,


uh, is huge.


So the thing they complain is not necessarily labor load.


Lots of is about sleeplessness headache,


uh, short of breath, uh, in, in work,


and, uh, uh, never see daylight.


One informant told me the biggest complaint was he,


she never saw daylight


because when she went to work, it's dark,


and she never, uh, le uh, left office, uh,


uh, before, uh, uh, sunset.


So whenever she was outside, she's always in the night.


Um, so this political change also means


that the category of class


and labor become probably less relevant.


And then what is, uh, life of force


and the life of force, I, I, my definition is a sustainable,


uh, capacity to interact with the external world.


I mean, that's a really banial definition, life force.


Uh, but here the key is, um,


is sustainable, I suppose.


Because what we observe, uh, in China is


that if you just look at on the surface,


then everyone appears to be full of life force


because they're so busy.


You know, these people never say, they never, uh, see


daylight, uh, outside.


It's very busy as if they are, she has


to constantly mobilize her vitality to, to work


and, uh, to fully alert the mind is fully,


this is why they said, you know, we just live on coffee


during the day and leave on sleeping pill in the night.


So the fully alert,


but that is a not a sustainable form of how you


interact with the world.


So the, the, uh, uh, the su the,


the sustainability here is what I want


to think a little more.


So, how do you, uh,


create a situation that you can interact


with the external world in a sustainable, uh, sustain,


sustainable manner?


Here? I think the, you have to, uh,


form a particular relation between the self


and as a world between your action and as a world response,


or between the world demand on you and the way you react.


You must have certain type of relation between you can say,


uh, the self and the world.


And my, I mean, this is not the theoretical work.


It is just based on ethnographic observation


and a very important, uh,


reason that why some condition will, uh,


give you this kind of sustainable capacity


of interacting with the world.


And then even, you know, you will have difficulties in such,


but you learn the difficult learn from the difficulties,


and you become, uh, you know, more powerful,


you feel more resilient, you can carry on, so


therefore sustainable and


or in other conditions, uh, it's just not a sustainable,


even though you are rewarded, uh, very generously.


Like students study very hard, have high scores,


and they got all the prizes,


but then they suddenly collapse.


Uh, so why this, uh, uh, what makes the difference


between these two modes of being very busy, uh,


uh, two modes of exercising your own vitality, um, is


that whether a person can, uh,


mobilize in the, if we use a phenomenological


term, is a stock of knowledge


or your stock of experiences to define


a situation in front of you, and also whether


or not you can mobilize your


ex relatively wide range of experiences to respond,


a challenge imposed by the world.


What I mean is that the, the typical condition


that the people feel their life force being drained is that


if there's a demand, they will respond to the demand very


directly without being able to mobilize knowledges


memories, experiences outside of the demand


and come up with his or her own definition of the demand.


So the typical example is, uh, in this kind of a pressure,


pressure cooker school system.


So students were, this is what education means.


Basically, students were put in such a, uh,


constant feedback loop.


You study very hard,


and then you get high score, then you get the reward,


and then you prepare for next exam and et cetera.


So such very clear causal, uh,


uh, uh, you know,


reward system actually can be very meaningful for people


because they see, ah, if I press this button, I study hard,


then I can get high school, I get the reward.


And this is why many young Chinese told me they felt


so difficult after they graduated from school,


when they start working.


I mean, of course that is a huge,


hugely different from my generation's experiences.


I said, why didn't you celebrate the fact


that now you are becoming economically independent?


You know, you are finally a full adult.


And as I said, it is so confusing in school, life was


so clear, there's one single


feedback loop I can follow.


So then inside of this loop, of course, you, you, you,


you are very, you can be very energized, very concentrated,


but this is also immediate cause of many mental,


uh, uh, problems.


And the reason is what I'm using this example to demon, to


to show what I mean, when you become a,


just a, a kind of mechanical agent, almost responding


to demand without being able to come up


with your own definition of the problem


by mobilizing your experiences, memories


beyond the demanded self.


And also this explains why the school system, you know, now


most students are boarding students


and very long hour workers, they really try to minimize any


time spent or space spent outside of the school,


you know, academic study.


It is precisely to shrink, to minimize the,


the reservoir of extra, uh, cru experiences.


Because once you have that, you will come back


and define the whole situation your own term.


So you probably will push back the, the, the, the situation.


So that is the, the, this kind of experiential basis


reservoir is a very important base of, of life force.


Yeah. So then life force probably finally, I, uh, you know,


I think is the, the key here is really is the, the relation,


as I said, the relation between the self, uh, uh,


and the, uh, the world.


And here it's, it's, it's quite a paradoxical here,


the life force, because on one hand the life force is some


something, uh, ultimately and extremely private,


because life force is something only you can feel.


It's a subjective feeling about whether you can act


on the world or not.


How you perceive the world


or not is only you have access to your life force.


And in many, many difficult situations, as we all experience


to, to different degrees,


that life force is the last resort that we have


to push back, difficult situation.


So it is very, very private.


Uh, so this is also, I think, you know, I want


to make a quick distinction between life force and the life.


The, in the, the philosophy of life, especially Fuko


and et cetera, is, uh, uh, life is in the, in the,


in the modern, uh, uh, system become objectified.


Life will become a subject and object of governance.


But life of force is something you cannot objectify


because it is very personal, private, uh,


but yet, uh, a life force


cannot come from inside.


Here is a Chinese,


and, uh, uh, I mean, it's not a philosophy, but just a chi.


You can say life philosophy


and a folk philosophy, which is a kind of combination


of Taoism to some extent, Confucianism


and Buddhism as well.


Because the life is, i is in a kind


of very sharp contrast to, to the European psychoanalysis.


The life, the essence of life is not coming from something


inside that you will review, you will discover


something that you can trace its origin to your childhood


or infant stage and et cetera.


Life is always a result of inhaling,


absorbing from the outside.


So this, like the Ong


and the tism, the idea, the, the, the, the essence,


the energy and the consciousness is all about the,


the assembling


and the concentration of energy outside.


So the, so the life is kind of, you can say figuration,


figuration of universal energy have this notion, I mean,


of course this is, you know, metaphysical


and such, what does that mean?


Uh, but it means this imaginary for me is very powerful


because it is to say that whether you can have a happy life,


whether or not you feel you are capable of dealing the world


very much depends on your capacity of inhaling,


absorbing different elements from our side.


So there's no clear core to start with.


It's a process of absorbing.


Uh, so this also I think is very, I mean,


this is my very wild, uh, speculation,


but I want to hear your view is about, you know,


does it provide a new angle for us to think of the relation


between, uh, nature and man,


or to rethink of the anthrop problem?


Uh, of course, you know, go back to Marx.


The labor is always a mediation between society


and nature, between man and, and, and nature.


And what he meant is that labor is,


the human agency acted on nature.


You know, you, you, you turn nature into


commodity and et cetera.


Today's situation may be the very opposite,


because many of us do not work on nature


and our labor subject, our labor output, our virtual


symbols, you know, the computer, uh, codes and, uh, language


and imaging sign and et cetera.


But the word link us to nature


could be our body.


It is ourself. And we did not feel that way.


It is because we were blinded by a particular understanding


of the self, of a human.


If you think of a human, if we become aist,


then we think we are just a figuration


of the natural energy,


and then we are part of the, the, the nature.


So the picture become reversed.


And this, I hope it's not just a, uh, you know, uh, uh,


feeble, intellectual, uh, uh, exercise,


but also it does have in impacts on


how we think of what a good life is.


And if you think your body in this way, do you still,


is it still so fun to spend so much money driving F1


and all that, right?


And whether or not as a whole, uh, uh, uh,


feeling the life force, how you experience


and the perceive life force will be different.


So this is a kind an anyway, just a bold invitation, whether


or not we can locate the nature back to the body itself


rather than to say, oh, you know, we have to, I mean,


then you, of course you develop new understanding about your


relation with the tree, with, with the forest, with,


with all the heat, uh, um,


with animal and et cetera.


So that is the kind of the, the absorbing, uh,


uh, uh, element.


So I, I was talking about the relation between the self


and the world, and then this is a positive part, right?


So you feel the life force being nourished, nurtured.


And in the Chinese, they use the word, it


means the moisturizing or, or nourishing and, and,


and grow, eh, so this's


and opposite to, to this is


that you feel a life force is being drained, being drained,


and then you have many examples, uh, being drained.


Uh, and as a Chinese word is au is kind


of internally drained.


And I feel that is very interesting


because imaginary is that someone steal your life force,


but your immediate feeling is that it is burned inside.


So there is, again, you know, it's,


they recognize it is external force is a cause


of their loss of life, of force,


but the immediate experience is very internal.


It's kind of draining internally, right?


So I found that is interesting


because I have not figured, uh, work this out yet.


I'm certainly, we wouldn't call the force consciousness,


but this kind of consciousness also shows


how external forces act on earth


through this internal, uh, uh, perceptions internal,


uh, experiences.


So this is why I feel that kind of the notion


of life force can open up this space,


open up this interface, uh, to make this interface


as a productive movement for intervention


for our intellectual labor intervention


of intellectual labor.


Yeah. So, uh, then this drained the feeling of being,


uh, drained internally.


Mm-hmm. As I mentioned, sorry, I was,


the talk is not very structured,


but it goes back to what I said earlier,


and based on my empirical observation,


people feel internally drained is often when


actually the external force


really confine them into certain system.


Uh, and as a result, they don't have enough experiential


or memory reservoir, uh, that they can rely on


and form their own, uh, uh, response,


or at least create a certain distance between themselves


and the external, uh, events,


if we use the everyday language to describe that.


So that's the, the, the, the, the, uh, uh, the,


the, the, the, the sustainability,


how the sustainability should be understood through, uh,


particular relation between the, the self,


uh, and the world.


So I don't know what it means,


but I feel, uh, that is interesting.


Uh, uh, topic to, again, is not a usual academic topic


to describe the world,


and it is a, uh, um, um,


is a, a word to intervene the world.


And this is, uh, yeah, as Alina mentioned, we wanted


to promote this common concern approach.


A common concern approach is approach that they wanted


to make research or become a piece of furniture.


It will travel back to people's life.


Uh, uh, so that's, yeah, this is a lu line.


Research is not only a mirror. Research is a motto. Motto.


It is an engine. It's not only a mirror, but it's a motto.


They can, people say, oh,


it's a distorted picture and et cetera.


But the Picasso, pictures, paintings all distorted.


But that particular type of distortion


allows certain understanding of the, of the,


of the, of the viewer.


You give agency to the viewer. Yeah.


So that's, uh, uh, uh, and then come back in.


What is, uh, the, um, my key point is that,


so can we understand capitalism and the political domination


and the pursuit, uh, for justice,


uh, as a struggle of, uh, life force


and then thinking that way, uh, that I have more


to say about this, about in the students movement,


because this is not a program.


There is a very clear plan,


and no one knows what will happen in next week.


Uh, but this is a genuine effort


of social change because we know


a totality, we know the problem,


and we know what we want to transcend.


But of course, we don't know the path


and we may be crushed all the time.


And at this moment, I think a certain perception


of life force is important.


And I think already the students make a huge contribution


to humanities, at least to me,


by really giving me extra life force now.


Thank you.
