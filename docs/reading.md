## [单读17：人的困境 - 几乎还有记忆](https://weread.qq.com/web/bookDetail/e303224071bfd314e305e77)

这一辑《单读》讨论困境，结果我们发现许多答案最后都关乎勇气。
我想这回答了前面说的，阅读到底是为了从别人那里获得什么。
很可能到最后，如果日常生活还有记忆，只会留下那些别样的生命态度。因为他们活得与你不同。

云也退评奥威尔，说“奥威尔征收恐惧，熔炼成克服恐惧的力量”。
诗人戴潍娜的演讲辞，“疼痛才是身体的重量，最初的人类一定是在劳动与疼痛的双重经验中成长为人”。
孔亚雷介绍詹姆斯·索特的小说，“除了名声，真正让一个人伟大的是更为内在，更为高贵，同时又更为简朴的什么。
那就是勇气。那是因风格而抛弃名利的勇气。
那是完全投入并创造自我的勇气”。
柏琳写圣彼得堡之旅，所有的作家、诗人都在虚空中向她大声私语，
其中就有马雅可夫斯基：
“你孤身一人，时常愤愤不平，急切地催促着命运，你知道，很快你就会快乐满足地投入到自己伟大的战斗中。”

困境只是一种关于人与世界相对关系的知识，能够穿透它的，才是人的教益。
所谓内在的危机——读书多了你会发现这危机是永恒的，
从别人一再的对它的描述中，你会得到某种分担，甚至也开始认识、辨别和描述它，它就没有那么可怕了。

## [单读17：人的困境 - 技术焦虑时代的文学修行](https://weread.qq.com/web/bookDetail/e303224071bfd314e305e77)

过去一段时间大家都被一个词疯狂刷屏，在朋友圈、微信、微博铺天盖地，
这个词从另一个侧面其实验证了我们对于这个时代的一个判断，这个词就是“佛系”​：
都行，可以，没关系；不争，不抢，认命，随缘。

不仅仅是90后，所有的人都在谈笑风生之间立地成佛。
我们仔细想一想，不争不抢真的是因为无欲无求吗？
还只是因为争不到、抢不得；认命随缘真的是看破红尘吗？
还是因为不知道自己到底要的是什么，看不清能够努力的方向。

在“佛系”风潮的背后其实隐藏着巨大的时代焦虑。
遁入空门并没有办法消除这样的焦虑。
在这种态度的背后，其实折射出这代人对于焦虑背后不同的心理应对的机制。

从进化心理学的角度来看，现实性焦虑不同于病理性的焦虑，
它是人类在进化过程中所形成的一种应对不确定性的情绪以及行为反应的模式。

在今天这个时代，这种不确定性所带来的焦虑被无限度放大。
我们不禁要想，为什么？
我们可以从政治、历史、文化上找到非常多的原因来解释个问题，
但我今天主要是谈一谈，技术如何让这个时代变得更加焦虑。

## [也许你该找个人聊聊](https://weread.qq.com/web/reader/16832d80726d70b6168b11e)

这个故事揭露了某种关于人生的真相。
人们有时会期待生是存在某种标准答案的，心理咨询师也许在专业学习中已经提前获知了这些答案
——至少有通往答案的“办法”​。
而真相令人失望。
当然了，某种意义上我们是学过一些心理学的办法，在这本书里，洛莉也会分享作为专业人士的一部分思考和操作。
但总的来说，你会看到最核心，也是最有效的办法，始终是一条常识：

你没法逃避痛苦，只能承认。

我们期待心理学为人生提供一份万试万灵的解忧良方，
我们真正幻想的是，或许我们这一生（至少绝大多数时候）​，是有办法免除痛苦的。
只要足够努力，找准方向，生命的苦痛无常会不会就是可以随时拂去的尘埃？

“万一这些痛苦不会改变呢？​”
这是我们最不愿意戳穿的真相。

虽然无力，但不得不承认现实。
沉溺于“不痛苦”的幻想，否认痛苦，有时反而会带来更大的麻烦。
跟普通人相比，心理咨询师对此认识更明确，也更熟悉如何与之相处。
每一次洛莉承认她的无力，都要承担由此而来的反噬。
她也有应对无力感的策略，比如默念“心怀慈悲”​，比如咨询间隙跟同事在咖啡间吐槽，
又比如定期参加督导小组，从同伴的反馈中获取支持。
作为同样爱写东西的人，我猜她把这些体验转化成文字，也是应对无力感的策略之一。

但最根本的办法，说来说去只有一个，就是诚实。
诚实地承担来访者遭遇的无常，也诚实接受自己哪怕有此觉悟，仍会有无法负担之重。

“那样的话，心理咨询还有什么用？​”人们可能会问。

要我来说，答案就是没用。
当然，有一个安全的地方，一个愿意倾听的人，人们可以有机会讲述这些痛苦，多多少少会让人得到一点告慰。
讲述本身应该是有意义的。
但如果再问，意义究竟有多大呢？很难说得清。

诚实总是困难的，尤其在自己特别想做点什么的时候，承认自己的无能为力。
有这样一种说法，当一个咨询师为某个案例特别头疼的时候，在他/她的生活里很可能也存在同样的挑战，
或许是过往的伤痛，或许是相似的难题——咨询师如果恐惧自己的衰老，就更难面对那些蹉跎时光的来访者；
如果是在自己的亲密关系中咽下苦果，遇到同款来访者就会急火攻心。
在生活中试图逃避的那一部分自我，坐在另一个人面前，日复一日催化，总有一天会原形毕露。

拯救我们的不再是任何道理或技巧，只有直面的勇气。

……

承认本身，就是最隐蔽也最关键的改变。

这就是心理学为什么用看上去如此无力的方式——交谈——去应对看起来如此无可改变之事。
当痛苦终于被言说，人们才能获得最基本的勇气，去看、去感知、去信任。
我们才有勇气从对方眼睛里看到自己在做什么，也有智慧去思考为什么做，或者，还存在哪些不同的选择。
语言让我们沉静，不急着改变，而是储备时间与能源。
交谈让我们接纳自己，接纳自己的痛苦，也接纳我们用来逃避痛苦的徒劳无功的尝试。
等做好准备，它会转变成更积极的行为。

故事的最后，或多或少，每个人都可以变好一些。

这是一个好故事。
每个人的改变都足够公平，与他们为之投入的代价相比，一分不多，一分不少——正是生活本来的样子。
洛莉用她和来访者们的每一处转折、每一段对话提醒你：
不要心存幻想。这个世界没有奇迹。
你无法逃避你所遇到的痛苦，心理学也不能提供任何幻想，
但不要忘了，世界上也有这样的地方，有这样一些人，可以直面这个无处可逃的、困惑的、痛苦的你。
你们坐在一起，随便谈谈。
你可以言说真实的你，而这就是心理咨询的奇迹所在。

瑞士著名心理学家卡尔·荣格说过：
“人们会想尽办法，各种荒谬的办法，来避免面对自己的灵魂。”
但他还说过：“只有直面灵魂的人，才会觉醒。”

## [Why Explore Space?](https://starforcep.github.io/sychaguan/tid-3486.html)

### English

In 1970, a Zambia-based nun named Sister Mary Jucunda wrote to Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger,
then-associate director of science at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center,
in response to his ongoing research into a piloted mission to Mars.
Specifically,
she asked how he could suggest spending billions of dollars
on such a project at a time
when so many children were starving on Earth.

Stuhlinger soon sent the following letter of explanation to Sister Jucunda,
along with a copy of "Earthrise,"
the iconic photograph of Earth taken in 1968 by astronaut William Anders,
from the Moon (also embedded in the transcript).
His thoughtful reply was later published by NASA,
and titled,
"Why Explore Space?"

May 6, 1970

Dear Sister Mary Jucunda:

Your letter was one of many which are reaching me every day,
but it has touched me more deeply than all the others
because it came so much from the depths of a searching mind
and a compassionate heart.
I will try to answer your question as best as I possibly can.

First,
however,
I would like to express my great admiration for you,
and for all your many brave sisters,
because you are dedicating your lives to the noblest cause of man:
help for his fellowmen who are in need.

You asked in your letter
how I could suggest the expenditures of billions of dollars for a voyage to Mars,
at a time when many children on this Earth are starving to death.
I know that you do not expect an answer such as
"Oh, I did not know that there are children dying from hunger,
but from now on I will desist from any kind of space research
until mankind has solved that problem!"
In fact,
I have known of famined children long before I knew
that a voyage to the planet Mars is technically feasible.
However,
I believe,
like many of my friends,
that travelling to the Moon and eventually to Mars and to other planets
is a venture which we should undertake now,
and I even believe that this project,
in the long run,
will contribute more to the solution of these grave problems
we are facing here on Earth than many other potential projects of help
which are debated and discussed year after year,
and which are so extremely slow in yielding tangible results.

Before trying to describe in more detail
how our space program is contributing to the solution of our Earthly problems,
I would like to relate briefly a supposedly true story,
which may help support the argument. About 400 years ago,
there lived a count in a small town in Germany.
He was one of the benign counts,
and he gave a large part of his income to the poor in his town.
This was much appreciated,
because poverty was abundant during medieval times,
and there were epidemics of the plague which ravaged the country frequently.
One day,
the count met a strange man.
He had a workbench and little laboratory in his house,
and he labored hard during the daytime
so that he could afford a few hours every evening to work in his laboratory.
He ground small lenses from pieces of glass;
he mounted the lenses in tubes,
and he used these gadgets to look at very small objects.
The count was particularly fascinated
by the tiny creatures that could be observed with the strong magnification,
and which he had never seen before.
He invited the man to move with his laboratory to the castle,
to become a member of the count's household,
and to devote henceforth all his time to the development
and perfection of his optical gadgets as a special employee of the count.

The townspeople,
however,
became angry when they realized that the count was wasting his money,
as they thought,
on a stunt without purpose.
"We are suffering from this plague,"
they said,
"while he is paying that man for a useless hobby!"
But the count remained firm.
"I give you as much as I can afford,"
he said,
"but I will also support this man and his work,
because I know that someday something will come out of it!"

Indeed,
something very good came out of this work,
and also out of similar work done by others at other places:
the microscope.
It is well known that the microscope
has contributed more than any other invention to the progress of medicine,
and that the elimination of the plague
and many other contagious diseases from most parts of the world
is largely a result of studies which the microscope made possible.

The count,
by retaining some of his spending money for research and discovery,
contributed far more to the relief of human suffering
than he could have contributed
by giving all he could possibly spare to his plague-ridden community.

The situation which we are facing today is similar in many respects.
The President of the United States is spending about 200 billion dollars
in his yearly budget.
This money goes to health,
education,
welfare,
urban renewal,
highways,
transportation,
foreign aid,
defense,
conservation,
science,
agriculture and many installations inside and outside the country.
About 1.6 percent of this national budget
was allocated to space exploration this year.
The space program includes Project Apollo,
and many other smaller projects in space physics,
space astronomy, space biology, planetary projects,
Earth resources projects, and space engineering.
To make this expenditure for the space program possible,
the average American taxpayer with 10,000 dollars income per year
is paying about 30 tax dollars for space.
The rest of his income, 9,970 dollars, remains for his subsistence,
his recreation, his savings, his other taxes, and all his other expenditures.

You will probably ask now:
"Why don't you take 5 or 3 or 1 dollar out of the 30 space dollars
which the average American taxpayer is paying,
and send these dollars to the hungry children?"
To answer this question, I have to explain briefly how the economy of this country works.
The situation is very similar in other countries.
The government consists of a number of departments
(Interior, Justice, Health, Education and Welfare, Transportation, Defense, and others)
and the bureaus
(National Science Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and others).
All of them prepare their yearly budgets according to their assigned missions,
and each of them must defend its budget
against extremely severe screening by congressional committees,
and against heavy pressure for economy from the Bureau of the Budget and the President.
When the funds are finally appropriated by Congress,
they can be spent only for the line items specified and approved in the budget.

The budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
naturally,
can contain only items directly related to aeronautics and space.
If this budget were not approved by Congress,
the funds proposed for it would not be available for something else;
they would simply not be levied from the taxpayer,
unless one of the other budgets had obtained approval for a specific increase
which would then absorb the funds not spent for space.
You realize from this brief discourse that support for hungry children,
or rather a support in addition to what the United States
is already contributing to this very worthy cause in the form of foreign aid,
can be obtained
only if the appropriate department submits a budget line item for this purpose,
and if this line item is then approved by Congress.

You may ask now whether I personally would be in favor of such a move by our government.
My answer is an emphatic yes.
Indeed,
I would not mind at all if my annual taxes were increased by a number of dollars
for the purpose of feeding hungry children,
wherever they may live.

I know that all of my friends feel the same way.
However,
we could not bring such a program to life merely
by desisting from making plans for voyages to Mars.
On the contrary,
I even believe that by working for the space program
I can make some contribution to the relief
and eventual solution of such grave problems as poverty and hunger on Earth.
Basic to the hunger problem are two functions:
the production of food and the distribution of food.
Food production by agriculture,
cattle ranching,
ocean fishing and other large-scale operations
is efficient in some parts of the world,
but drastically deficient in many others.
For example,
large areas of land could be utilized far better
if efficient methods of watershed control,
fertilizer use,
weather forecasting,
fertility assessment,
plantation programming,
field selection,
planting habits,
timing of cultivation,
crop survey and harvest planning were applied.

The best tool for the improvement of all these functions,
undoubtedly,
is the artificial Earth satellite.
Circling the globe at a high altitude,
it can screen wide areas of land within a short time;
it can observe and measure a large variety of factors
indicating the status and condition of crops,
soil,
droughts,
rainfall,
snow cover,
etc.,
and it can radio this information to ground stations for appropriate use.
It has been estimated
that even a modest system of Earth satellites equipped with Earth resources,
sensors,
working within a program for worldwide agricultural improvements,
will increase the yearly crops by an equivalent of many billions of dollars.

The distribution of the food to the needy is a completely different problem.
The question is not so much one of shipping volume,
it is one of international cooperation.
The ruler of a small nation may feel very uneasy about the prospect
of having large quantities of food shipped into his country by a large nation,
simply because he fears that along with the food there
may also be an import of influence and foreign power.
Efficient relief from hunger,
I am afraid, will not come before the boundaries
between nations have become less divisive than they are today.
I do not believe that space flight will accomplish this miracle over night.
However,
the space program is certainly among the most promising
and powerful agents working in this direction.

Let me only remind you of the recent near-tragedy of Apollo 13.
When the time of the crucial reentry of the astronauts approached,
the Soviet Union discontinued all Russian radio transmissions
in the frequency bands used by the Apollo Project
in order to avoid any possible interference,
and Russian ships stationed themselves in the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans
in case an emergency rescue would become necessary.
Had the astronaut capsule touched down near a Russian ship,
the Russians would undoubtedly
have expended as much care and effort in their rescue
as if Russian cosmonauts had returned from a space trip.
If Russian space travelers should ever be in a similar emergency situation,
Americans would do the same without any doubt.

Higher food production through survey and assessment from orbit,
and better food distribution through improved international relations,
are only two examples
of how profoundly the space program will impact life on Earth.
I would like to quote two other examples:
stimulation of technological development,
and generation of scientific knowledge.

The requirements for high precision and for extreme reliability
which must be imposed upon the components of a moon-travelling spacecraft
are entirely unprecedented in the history of engineering.
The development of systems which meet these severe requirements
has provided us a unique opportunity to find new material and methods,
to invent better technical systems,
to manufacturing procedures,
to lengthen the lifetimes of instruments,
and even to discover new laws of nature.

All this newly acquired technical knowledge
is also available for application to Earth-bound technologies.
Every year,
about a thousand technical innovations generated in the space program
find their ways into our Earthly technology
where they lead to better kitchen appliances and farm equipment,
better sewing machines and radios,
better ships and airplanes,
better weather forecasting and storm warning, better communications,
better medical instruments,
better utensils and tools for everyday life.
Presumably,
you will ask now why we must develop first a life support system
for our moon-travelling astronauts,
before we can build a remote-reading sensor system for heart patients.
The answer is simple:
significant progress in the solutions of technical problems
is frequently made not by a direct approach,
but by first setting a goal of high challenge
which offers a strong motivation for innovative work,
which fires the imagination and spurs men to expend their best efforts,
and which acts as a catalyst by including chains of other reactions.

Spaceflight without any doubt is playing exactly this role.
The voyage to Mars will certainly not be a direct source of food for the hungry.
However,
it will lead to so many new technologies and capabilities that the spin-offs
from this project alone will be worth many times the cost of its implementation.

Besides the need for new technologies,
there is a continuing great need for new basic knowledge in the sciences
if we wish to improve the conditions of human life on Earth.
We need more knowledge in physics and chemistry,
in biology and physiology,
and very particularly in medicine to cope with all these problems
which threaten man's life:
hunger,
disease,
contamination of food and water,
pollution of the environment.

We need more young men and women
who choose science as a career and we need better support for those scientists
who have the talent and the determination to engage in fruitful research work.
Challenging research objectives must be available,
and sufficient support for research projects must be provided.
Again,
the space program with its wonderful opportunities
to engage in truly magnificent research studies of moons and planets,
of physics and astronomy,
of biology and medicine is an almost ideal catalyst
which induces the reaction between the motivation for scientific work,
opportunities to observe exciting phenomena of nature,
and material support needed to carry out the research effort.

Among all the activities which are directed,
controlled,
and funded by the American government,
the space program is certainly the most visible
and probably the most debated activity,
although it consumes only 1.6 percent of the total national budget,
and 3 per mille
(less than one-third of 1 percent)
of the gross national product.
As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies,
and for research in the basic sciences,
it is unparalleled by any other activity.
In this respect,
we may even say that the space program is taking over a function
which for three or four thousand years
has been the sad prerogative of wars.

How much human suffering can be avoided if nations,
instead of competing with their bomb-dropping fleets of airplanes and rockets,
compete with their moon-travelling space ships!
This competition is full of promise for brilliant victories,
but it leaves no room for the bitter fate of the vanquished,
which breeds nothing but revenge and new wars.

Although our space program seems to lead us
away from our Earth and out toward the moon,
the sun,
the planets,
and the stars,
I believe that none of these celestial objects will find as much attention
and study by space scientists as our Earth.
It will become a better Earth,
not only because of all the new technological and scientific knowledge
which we will apply to the betterment of life,
but also because we are developing a far deeper appreciation of our Earth,
of life,
and of man.

![Earthrise](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/apollo08_earthrise.jpg "Apollo 8: Earthrise")

The photograph
which I enclose with this letter shows a view of our Earth as seen from Apollo 8
when it orbited the moon at Christmas, 1968.
Of all the many wonderful results of the space program so far,
this picture may be the most important one.
It opened our eyes to the fact
that our Earth is a beautiful
and most precious island in an unlimited void,
and that there is no other place for us to live but the thin surface layer of our planet,
bordered by the bleak nothingness of space.
Never before did so many people recognize how limited our Earth really is,
and how perilous it would be to tamper with its ecological balance.
Ever since this picture was first published,
voices have become louder and louder warning of the grave problems
that confront man in our times:
pollution,
hunger,
poverty,
urban living,
food production,
water control,
overpopulation.
It is certainly not by accident that we begin to see the tremendous tasks
waiting for us at a time when the young space age
has provided us the first good look at our own planet.

Very fortunately though,
the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves,
it also provides us with the technologies,
the challenge,
the motivation,
and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence.
What we learn in our space program,
I believe, is fully supporting
what Albert Schweitzer had in mind when he said:
"I am looking at the future with concern, but with good hope."

My very best wishes will always be with you,
and with your children.

Very sincerely yours,

Ernst Stuhlinger

Associate Director for Science

### 简体中文

1970年，赞比亚修女 Mary Jucunda 给 Ernst Stuhlinger 博士写了一封信，
他因在火星之旅工程中的原创性研究，
成为 NASA（美国航空航天局）Marshall 太空航行中心的科学副总监。
信中，Mary Jucunda 修女问道：
目前地球上还有这么多小孩子吃不上饭，
他怎么能舍得为远在火星的项目花费数十亿美元。

Stuhlinger 很快给Jucunda 修女回了信，
同时还附带了一张题为“升起的地球”的照片，
这张标志性的照片是宇航员 William Anders 于1968年在月球轨道上拍摄的（照片中可以看到月球的地面）。
他这封真挚的回信随后由 NASA 以《为什么要探索宇宙》为标题发表。

1970年5月6日

亲爱的Mary Jucunda修女：

每天，我都会收到很多类似的来信，
但这封对我的触动最深，
因为它来自一颗慈悲的饱含探求精神的心灵。
我会尽自己所能来回答你这个问题。

首先，请允许我向你以及你勇敢的姐妹们表达深深的敬意，
你们献身于人类最崇高的事业：帮助身处困境的同胞。

在来信中，你问我在目前地球上还有儿童由于饥饿面临死亡威胁的情况下，
为什么还要花费数十亿美元来进行飞向火星的航行。
我清楚你肯定不希望这样的答案：
“哦，我之前不知道还有小孩子快饿死了，
好吧，从现在开始，暂停所有的太空项目，直到孩子们都吃上饭再说。”
事实上，早在了解火星之旅的技术之前，我已经对儿童的饥荒问题有所了解。
而且，同我很多朋友的看法一样，我认为此时此刻，
我们就应该开始通往月球、火星乃至其他行星的伟大探险。
从长远来看，相对于那些要么只有年复一年的辩论和争吵，
要么连妥协之后也迟迟无法落实的各种援助计划来说，
我甚至觉得探索太空的工程给更有助于解决人类目前所面临的种种危机。

在详细说明我们的太空项目如何帮助解决地面上的危机之前，我想先简短讲一个真实的故事。
那是在400年前，德国某小镇里有一位伯爵。
他是个心地善良的人，他将自己收入的一大部分捐给了镇子上的穷人。
这十分令人钦佩，因为中世纪时穷人很多，而且那时经常爆发席卷全国的瘟疫。
一天，伯爵碰到了一个奇怪的人，他家中有一个工作台和一个小实验室，
他白天卖力工作，每天晚上的几小时的时间专心进行研究。
他把小玻璃片研磨成镜片，然后把研磨好的镜片装到镜筒里，用此来观察细小的物件。
伯爵被这个前所未见的可以把东西放大观察的小发明迷住了。
他邀请这个怪人住到了他的城堡里，
作为伯爵的门客，此后他可以专心投入所有的时间来研究这些光学器件。

然而，镇子上的人得知伯爵在这么一个怪人和他那些无用的玩意儿上花费金钱之后，
都很生气，“我们还在受瘟疫的苦”，
他们抱怨道，“而他却为那个闲人和他没用的爱好乱花钱！”
伯爵听到后不为所动，“我会尽可能地接济大家”，
他表示，“但我会继续资助这个人和他的工作，我确信终有一天会有回报。”

果不其然，他的工作赢来了丰厚的回报：显微镜。
显微镜的发明给医学带来了前所未有的发展，
由此展开的研究及其成果，
消除了世界上大部分地区肆虐的瘟疫和其他一些传染性疾病。

伯爵为支持这项研究发明所花费的金钱，
其最终结果大大减轻了人类所遭受的苦难，
这回报远远超过单纯将这些钱用来救济那些遭受瘟疫的人。

我们目前面临类似的问题。
美国总统的年度预算共有2000亿美元，
这些钱将用于医疗、教育、福利、城市建设、高速公路、交通运输、
海外援助、国防、环保、科技、农业以及其他多项国内外的工程。
今年，预算中的1.6%将用于探索宇宙，
这些花销将用于阿波罗以计划、
其他一些涵盖了天体物理学、深空天文学、空间生物学、行星探测工程、
地球资源工程的小项目以及空间工程技术。
为担负这些太空项目的支出，
平均每个年收入10,000美元的美国纳税人需要支付约30美元给太空，
剩下的9,970美元则可用于一般生活开支、休闲娱乐、储蓄、别的税项等花销。

也许你会问：
“为什么不从纳税人为太空支付的30美元里抽出5美元或3美元或是1美元来救济饥饿的儿童呢？”
为了回答这个问题，我需要先简单解释一下我们国家的经济是如何运行的，其他国家也是类似的情形。
政府由几个部门
（如内政部、司法部、卫生部与公众福利部、教育部、运输部、国防部等）
和几个机构
（国家科学基金会、国家航空航天局等）组成，
这些部门和机构根据自己的职能制定相应的年度预算，
并严格执行以应对国务委员会的监督，
同时还要应付来自预算部门和总统对于其经济效益的压力。
当资金最终由国会拨出后，将严格用于经预算批准的计划中的项目。

显然，NASA的预算中所包含的项目都是和航空航天有关的。
未经国会批准的预算项目，是不会得到资金支持的，自然也不会被课税，
除非有其他部门的预算涵盖了该项目，借此花掉没有分配给太空项目的资金。
由这段简短的说明可以看出，要想援助饥饿的儿童，
或在美国已有的对外援助项目上增加援助金额，
需要首先由相关部门提出预算，然后由国会批准才行。

要问是否同意政府实施类似的政策，我个人的意见是绝对赞成。
我完全不介意每年多付出一点点税款来帮助饥饿的儿童，无论他们身在何处。

我相信我的朋友们也会持相同的态度。
然而，事情并不是仅靠把去往火星航行的计划取消就能轻易实现的。
相对的，我甚至认为可以通过太空项目，来为缓解乃至最终解决地球上的贫穷和饥饿问题作出贡献。
解决饥饿问题的关键有两部分：食物的生产和食物的发放。
食物的生产所涉及的农业、畜牧业、渔业及其他大规模生产活动在世界上的一些地区高效高产，
而在有的地区则产量严重不足。
通过高科技手段，如灌溉管理，肥料的使用，天气预报，产量评估，程序化种植，农田优选，
作物的习性与耕作时间选择，农作物调查及收割计划，可以显著提高土地的生产效率。

人造地球卫星无疑是改进这两个关键问题最有力的工具。
在远离地面的运行轨道上，卫星能够在很短的时间里扫描大片的陆地，
可以同时观察计算农作物生长所需要的多项指标，土壤、旱情、雨雪天气等等，
并且可以将这些信息广播至地面接收站以便做进一步处理。
事实证明，配备有土地资源传感器及相应的农业程序的人造卫星系统，
即便是最简单的型号，也能给农作物的年产量带来数以十亿美元计的提升。

如何将食品发放给需要的人则是另外一个全新的问题，
关键不在于轮船的容量，而在于国际间的合作。
小国统治者对于来自大国的大量食品的输入很难做出准确的判断，
他们害怕伴随着食物一同而来的还有外国势力对其统治地位的影响。
恐怕在国与国之间消除隔阂之前，饥饿问题无法得以高效解决了。
我不认为太空计划能一夜之间创造奇迹，
然而，探索宇宙有助于促使问题向着良好的方向发展。

以最近发生的阿波罗13号事故为例。
当宇航员处于关键的大气层再入期时，
为了保证通讯畅通，苏联关闭了境内与阿波罗飞船所用频带相同的所有广播通信。
同时派出舰艇到太平洋和大西洋海域以备第一时间进行搜救工作。
如果宇航员的救生舱降落到俄方舰船附近，
俄方人员会像对待从太空返回的本国宇航员一样对他们进行救助。
同样，如果俄方的宇宙飞船遇到了类似的紧急情况，美国也一定会毫不犹豫地提供援助。

通过卫星进行监测与分析来提高食品产量，
以及通过改善国际关系提高食品发放的效率，
只是通过太空项目提高人类生活质量的两个方面。
下面我想介绍另外两个重要作用：
促进科学技术的发展和提高一代人的科学素养。

登月工程需要历史上前所未有的高精度和高可靠性。
面对如此严苛的要求，我们要寻找新材料，新方法；开发出更好的工程系统；
用更可靠的制作流程；让仪器的工作寿命更长久；甚至需要探索全新的自然规律。

这些为登月发明的新技术同样可以用于地面上的工程项目。
每年，都有大概一千项从太空项目中发展出来的新技术被用于日常生活中，
这些技术打造出更好的厨房用具和农场设备，更好的缝纫机和收音机，更好的轮船和飞机，
更精确的天气预报和风暴预警，更好的通讯设施，更好的医疗设备，乃至更好的日常小工具。
你可能会问为什么先设计出宇航员登月舱的维生系统，而不是先为听力障碍患者造出有声阅读设备呢。
答案很简单：解决工程问题时，重要的技术突破往往并不是按部就班直接得到的，
而是来自能够激发出强大创新精神，能够燃起的想象力和坚定的行动力，
以及能够整合好所有资源的充满挑战的目标。

太空旅行无可置疑地是一项充满挑战的事业。
通往火星的航行并不能直接提供食物解决饥荒问题。
然而，它所带来大量的新技术和新方法可以用在火星项目之外，
这将产生数倍于原始花费的收益。

若希望人类生活得越来越好，除了需要新的技术，我们还需要基础科学不断有新的进展。
包括物理学和化学，生物学和生理学，
特别是医学，用来照看人类的健康，
应对饥饿、疾病、食物和水的污染以及环境污染等问题。

我们需要更多的年轻人投入到科学事业中来，
我们需要给予那些投身科研事业的有天分的科学家更多的帮助。
随时要有富于挑战的研究项目，同时要保证对项目给予充分的资源支持。
在此我要重申，太空项目是科技进步的催化剂，它为学术研究工作提供了绝佳和实践机会，
包括对月球和其他行星的研究、物理学和天文学、生物学和医学科学等学科，
有它，科学界源源不断出现令人激动不已研究课题，人类得以窥见宇宙无比瑰丽的景象；
为了它，新技术新方法不断涌现。

由美国政府控制并提供资金支持的所有活动中，太空项目无疑最引人瞩目也最容易引起争议，
尽管其仅占全部预算的1.6%，不到全民生产总值的千分之三。
作为新技术的驱动者和催化剂，太空项目开展了多项基础科学的研究，它的地位注定不同于其他活动。
从某种意义上来说，以太空项目的对社会的影响，其地位相当于3-4千年前的战争活动。

如果国家之间不再比拼轰炸机和远程导弹，
取而代之比拼月球飞船的性能，那将避免多少战乱之苦！
聪慧的胜利者将满怀希望，失败者也不用饱尝痛苦，
不再埋下仇恨的种子，不再带来复仇的战争。

尽管我们开展的太空项目研究的东西离地球很遥远，
已经将人类的视野延伸至月亮、至太阳、至星球、直至那遥远的星辰，
但天文学家对地球的关注，超过以上所有天外之物。
太空项目带来的不仅有那些新技术所所提供的生活品质的提升，
随着对宇宙研究的深入，我们对地球，对生命，对人类自身的感激之情将越深。
太空探索让地球更美好。

随信一块寄出的这张照片，是1968年圣诞节那天阿波罗8号在环月球轨道上拍摄的地球的景象。
太空项目所能带来的各种结果中，这张照片也许是其中最可贵的一项。
它开阔了人类的视野，
让我们如此直观地感受到到地球是广阔无垠的宇宙中如此美丽而又珍贵的孤岛，
同时让我们认识到地球是我们唯一的家园，离开地球就是荒芜阴冷的外太空。
无论在此之前人们对地球的了解是多么的有限，
对于破坏生态平衡的严重后果的认识是多么的不充分。
在这张照片公开发表之后，面对人类目前所面临的种种严峻形势，
如环境污染、饥饿、贫穷、过度城市化、粮食问题、水资源问题、人口问题等等，
号召大家正视这些严重问题的呼声越来越多。
人们突然表示出对自身问题的关注，
不能说和目前正在进行的这些初期太空探索项目，
以及它所带来的对于人类自身家园的全新视角无关。

太空探索不仅仅给人类提供一面审视自己的镜子，
它还能给我们带来全新的技术，全新的挑战和进取精神，
以及面对严峻现实问题时依然乐观自信的心态。
我相信，人类从宇宙中学到的，
充分印证了Albert Schweitzer那句名言：
“我忧心忡忡地看待未来，但仍满怀美好的希望。”

向您和您的孩子们致以我最真挚的敬意！

您诚挚的

## [Pale Blue Dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot)

### English

From this distant vantage point,
the Earth might not seem of any particular interest.
But for us,
it's different.
Consider again that dot.
That's here.
That's home.
That's us.
On it everyone you love,
everyone you know,
everyone you ever heard of,
every human being who ever was,
lived out their lives.
The aggregate of our joy and suffering,
thousands of confident religions,
ideologies,
and economic doctrines,
every hunter and forager,
every hero and coward,
every creator and destroyer of civilization,
every king and peasant,
every young couple in love,
every mother and father,
hopeful child,
inventor and explorer,
every teacher of morals,
every corrupt politician,
every "superstar",
every "supreme leader",
every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there
– on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.
Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that,
in glory and triumph,
they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.
Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants
of one corner of this pixel
on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner,
how frequent their misunderstandings,
how eager they are to kill one another,
how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings,
our imagined self-importance,
the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe,
are challenged by this point of pale light.
Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.
In our obscurity,
in all this vastness,
there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.
There is nowhere else,
at least in the near future,
to which our species could migrate.
Visit, yes.
Settle, not yet.
Like it or not,
for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling
and character-building experience.
There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits
than this distant image of our tiny world.
To me,
it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another,
and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot,
the only home we've ever known.

### 简体中文

“再来看一眼这个小点。
就在这里。
这就是家。
这就是我们。
在这个小点上，每一个你爱的人，每一个你认识的人，每一个你听说过的人，
每一个人，无论是谁，都在此度过一生。
我们所有的快乐和挣扎，数以千万自傲的宗教信仰、思想体系观念意识，以及经济学原理教义，
每一个猎人或征服者，每一位勇士或懦夫，每一个文明的缔造者或摧毁者，
每一位君王或农夫，每一对陷入爱河的年轻伴侣，每一位为人父母者，
所有充满希望的小孩、发明家或探险者，每一位灵魂导师，每一个腐败的政客，
每一个所谓的‘超级巨星’，每一个所谓的‘至高领袖’，每一位我们人类史上的圣人或罪人……
我们的一切一切，全部都存在于这样一粒悬浮在一束阳光中的尘埃上。

地球，只是浩瀚宇宙竞技场上一个小小的舞台。
想想那些帝王将相扬起的腥风血雨，只为在荣耀和胜利中，短暂享受主宰著一个小点上一小部分的滋味。
想想有些永无止境的残暴，竟然就发生在这个小点上某个角落里的一群人、
与几乎分不出任何区别的同样这一个小点上的另一个角落的另一群人之间。
他们之间的误解能有多频繁，
他们之间想灭掉对方的愿望能有多迫切，他们之间互相的仇恨能有多炽烈。

我们的装腔作势与妄自尊大，我们以为自己在宇宙中享有特权的幻想，都被这颗发着微弱蓝光的小点所挑战。
我们的这颗星球，是一粒孤孤单单的微尘，被包裹在宇宙浩瀚的黑暗中。
在我们有限的认知里，在这一片浩瀚之中，没有任何迹象表明救助会从别处而来帮助我们救赎自己。

目前为止，地球是我们唯一所知有生命居住的世界。
没有其他地方
——至少是在不远的未来里，可供我们这一物种移民。
我们能够造访，但尚不能常驻。
不管你喜欢还是不喜欢，目前为止只有地球是我们的立足之地。

有人说，天文学是一门令人谦卑的、同时也是塑造性情的学问。
也许没有什么能比从遥远太空拍摄到的我们微小世界的这张照片，更能展示人类的自负有多愚蠢。
对我而言，这也是在提醒我们的责任所在：
更和善地对待彼此，并维护和珍惜这颗暗蓝色的小点
——这个我们目前所知唯一的家园。”

Hello, brother.
If you're listening to this, the world is still here and so are you.
For the record, I never had a moment of doubt.
I knew you'd find a way.
You always do.
I hope, in time, you can see this life is not some quirk of fate.
This was your calling.
Your destiny.
A destiny that touches every living thing.
Like it or not, we are masters of our fate.
Nothing is written.
And our cause, however righteous, pales in comparison to the impact of our effect.
Any hope for a better future comes from willing that future into being.
A future reflecting the measure of good within ourselves.
And all that is good inside us is measured by the good we do for others.
We all share the same fate -- the same future.
The sum of our infinite choices.
One such future is built on kindness, trust, and mutual understanding, should we choose to accept it.
Driving without question towards a light we cannot see.
Not just for those we hold close, but for those we'll never meet.
I hope you know I'll always love you, brother.
And I will see you again, though I hope it's not too soon.
The world still needs you.
Of course, they'll never know it, but we did it.
We, who live and die in the shadows.
This message will self-destruct in five seconds.
Good luck, Ethan.

### 简体中文

你好，兄弟。
如果你正在听这段录音，说明世界仍在，你也还在。
郑重声明，我从未有过片刻怀疑。
我就知道你会找到办法，你总是能做到。

我希望你最终能明白，这场人生并非命运的偶然。
这是你的使命，你的宿命
——一个会触及世间万物的宿命。
不管你愿不愿意，我们都是命运的主宰。
没有什么是命中注定的。
我们的事业无论多么正义，相较于我们所产生的影响都黯然失色。

对美好未来的所有希望，都源于我们将其变为现实的决心。
这个未来应反映我们内心的善良，而我们内心的善良，是通过为他人做的善事来衡量的。
我们都拥有相同的命运
——相同的未来，这是我们无数选择的总和。

如果我们愿意接受，其中一种未来将建立在善良、信任与相互理解之上。
毫不犹豫地朝着我们看不见的光明前行，不仅为了我们所爱的人，也为了那些素未谋面的人。

我希望你知道，我永远爱你，兄弟。
我们定会重逢，但我希望不是太快。
世界仍需要你。
当然，他们永远不会知道，但我们做到了
——我们这些在阴影中出生入死的人。

这条信息将在五秒后自毁。祝你好运，伊森。

### [English](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5218268/characters/nm0000215/)

**Dr. Wong**: Rick,
the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence
and the sickness destroying your family
is that everyone in your family,
you included,
use intelligence to justify sickness.
You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force
and as an inescapable curse,
and I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you
is that it's your mind,
within your control.
You chose to come here, you chose to talk,
to belittle my vocation,
just as you chose to become a pickle.
You are the master of your universe
and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces,
your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.
I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy,
the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass,
because the thing about repairing,
maintaining,
and cleaning is;
it's not an adventure.
There's no way to do it so wrong you might die.
It's just work, and the bottom line
is some people are okay going to work,
and some people,
well,
some people would rather die.
Each of us gets to choose.

### [简体中文](https://bangumi.tv/ep/718062)

**王医生**：瑞克，
你那毋庸置疑的智慧和摧毁你家庭的疾病之间唯一的联系，
就在于你家人，包括你自己，都用智慧来为疾病辩护。
你似乎时而将自己的思想视为势不可挡的力量，
时而又将其视为无法逃脱的诅咒，
我认为这是因为对你来说，
唯一真正难以理解的概念就是它是你的思想，在你的掌控之中。
你选择来到这里，你选择与我交谈，贬低我的职业，
就像你选择成为一块腌黄瓜一样。
你是你宇宙的主宰，却浑身沾满老鼠血和粪便，
你那庞大的头脑简直就是在你自己的手中枯萎。
我毫不怀疑，你会对治疗感到无比无聊，
就像我刷牙擦屁股时感到无聊一样，
因为修理、维护和清洁的意义在于：它不是冒险。
这些事做错了你也不会死。
这只是工作而已，
归根结底，有些人愿意工作，而有些人，嗯，有些人宁愿去死。
我们每个人都要选择。
